    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of flat pasta sheets, rich meat or vegetable sauce, creamy ricotta or béchamel, and melted mozzarella cheese. The dish is often baked until bubbly and golden, creating a delightful combination of soft pasta, savory sauce, and gooey cheese with a slightly crispy top. The most popular version, lasagna al forno, features a hearty meat sauce made from ground beef or sausage, simmered in tomatoes and Italian herbs. Lasagna is a comforting, filling dish that's perfect for family meals or special occasions, offering a delicious blend of flavors in every bite.</p>
