    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p> Macaroni and cheese, often referred to as mac and cheese, is a classic comfort dish made by combining tender elbow macaroni pasta with a rich, creamy cheese sauce. The sauce is typically made from a blend of melted cheeses, butter, and milk, creating a smooth, indulgent texture that coats the pasta. Some recipes add a crispy topping, like breadcrumbs or extra cheese, and bake it until golden brown. Mac and cheese is beloved for its simple yet satisfying combination of flavors and textures, offering a warm, hearty meal that's perfect on its own or as a side dish. </p>
