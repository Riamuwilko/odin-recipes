## Caveat/Future of Odin Recipe
Understanding that Odin Recipe is presently in its proof-of-concept phase, it may lack some of the more sophisticated features. As the sole contributor to this project, it serves as a valuable learning experience for me. Operating without a dedicated team, Odin Recipe is essentially a passion project, albeit one with limited functionalities at this point. I acknowledge that certain essential considerations, such as scalability, have not been fully addressed. Nevertheless, I remain open to future enhancements.
